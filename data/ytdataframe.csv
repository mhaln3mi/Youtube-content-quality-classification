JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in 2022. A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers. 

I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding. 

Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast. 

You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time. 

If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know. 

You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications. 

If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.

It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

42,Xm4BObh4MhI,Code with Ania Kubów,12HR+ YouTube Coding Bootcamp!,"Just bring your laptop!

Hello everyone and welcome to this online Coding Bootcamp. This Bootcamp has been designed specifically to make your coding journey easier by utilising all of @YouTube functionalities such as the Timestamps and Cards. 

We will be using the Timestamps to break up our Bootcamp into sections, so that you can easily navigate to and from each one using the description below. I will also be using Cards in order to direct you to an external project you can try, based on where we are in our Coding Journey.

I have also provided Code Sandboxes at the bottom for those stuck on code setup for the learning sections. I would advise to always type out the code to each exercise yourself, but as a safety net, they are provided as well. 

This 12hr+ Bootcamp is unsponsored and free and will always be free, so if you enjoy it please do give a big thumbs up and Subscribe!

In today's video, I will show you how to create a beautiful (I think 🙈) data visualization dashboard in Python from your Jupyter Notebooks. I had a lot of fun doing this project and I hope you will have fun watching it as well.

52,FNYdBLwZ6cE,techTFQ,Learn how to write SQL Queries(Practice Complex SQL Queries),"Learn how to write SQL Queries(Practice Complex SQL Queries)
In this video, I will explain the thinking behind writing an SQL query. We shall go through five different complex SQL queries and try to solve it. The intention is to practice complex SQL queries.  The idea is to not just write SQL Queries but also to explain you the thinking behind how to choose a particular approach to solve a SQL query and how to choose different SQL functions or concepts to solve a problem.

Link to my blog where I have posted all of these SQL Queries:
https://techtfq.com/blog/learn-how-to-write-sql-queries-practice-complex-sql-queries

In this blog, you will find 9 SQL queries along with all the scripts to create the table, load data into these tables and also the solved SQL Queries. Out of these 9 SQL Queries, In this video, I have only solved 5 of them in order to reduce the video length.

Timeline:
00:00 Intro
01:36 Intro about the blog
03:25 SQL Query to fetch duplicate records from a table using window function
09:27 SQL Query to fetch doctors working in same hospital using self join
15:55 SQL Query to fetch users who logged in consecutively 3 or more times
25:10 SQL Query to fetch days when the temperature was very cold for consecutively 3 or more days
36:13 SQL Query to fetch top 2 accounts with maximum patients per month

Learning SQL Concepts and practically writing SQL queries are two different things. You may be familiar with the concept such as window function but until and unless you apply these concepts to write SQL queries, you will never truly understand SQL.

May of the queries I am going to solve in this video, I will be using window function such as LEAD, LAG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER etc. However, some of the queries are solved using self join, sub queries or inner joins.

The idea behind making this video, is to explain the thinking behind solving an SQL question. How to read the question and understand the problem statement and then analyze the existing data so that we can come up with an approach to write a query which can return the required result. These steps are very important in order for us to determine the different SQL concepts or functions to be used to solve the problem.

Please comment below your feedback if you liked this kind of video or if you have any doubts on any other queries mentioned in the blog.

62,6yAAV-uP0po,Kevin Powell,How to use CSS object-fit to control your images,"Object-fit allows you to control your image in much of the same way you can do with background-image and background-size, but with even more properties at its disposal! It gives us 'cover' and 'contain' as well as 'fill', 'scale-down' and 'none', and 'none' works in a totally unexpected way (it's not the default!)

And the intro thing... that's what happens when you're doing the final touches when you should have been in bed 3 hours earlier, lol.

It is important to understand this technique if you are pursuing a career as a data scientist or a machine learning engineer. In this video we will see a very simple explanation of what a gradient descent is for a neural network or a logistic regression (remember logistic regression is a very simple single neuron neural network). We will than implement gradient descent from scratch in python.
In my machine learning tutorial series I already have a video on gradient descent but that one is on linear regression whereas this video is for logistic regression for neural network. Here is the link of my linear regression GD video,

The field of data analytics is quite large and what you might be aiming to do with it is likely to never match up exactly to any tutorial. With that in mind, I think the best way for us to approach learning data analysis with Python is simply by example. My plan here is to find some datasets and do some of the common data analysis tasks, using the Pandas package, to hopefully get you familiar enough with the package to work with it on your own.

Cron job will only work on unix based machines. It consists of a configuration file called Crontable which is also known as Crontab.

102,VwVg9jCtqaU,TensorFlow,Machine Learning Zero to Hero (Google I/O'19),"This is a talk for people who know code, but who don’t necessarily know machine learning. Learn the ‘new’ paradigm of machine learning, and how models are an alternative implementation for some logic scenarios, as opposed to writing if/then rules and other code. This session will guide you through understanding many of the new concepts in machine learning that you might not be familiar with including eager mode, training loops, optimizers, and loss functions.

103,KNAWp2S3w94,TensorFlow,Intro to Machine Learning (ML Zero to Hero - Part 1),"Machine Learning represents a new paradigm in programming, where instead of programming explicit rules in a language such as Java or C++, you build a system which is trained on data to infer the rules itself. But what does ML actually look like? In part one of Machine Learning Zero to Hero, AI Advocate Laurence Moroney (lmoroney@) walks through a basic Hello World example of building an ML model, introducing ideas which we'll apply in later episodes to a more interesting problem: computer vision.

In episode one, we showed a scenario of rock, paper, and scissors; and discussed how difficult it might be to write code to detect and classify these. As the episodes have progressed into machine learning, we’ve learned how to build neural networks from detecting patterns in raw pixels, to classifying them, to detecting features using convolutions. In this episode, we have put all the information from the first three parts of the series into one.

142,cCKOl5li6YM,Nemean,How Karatsuba's algorithm gave us new ways to multiply,"To advance the field of computer science, mathematician Kolmogorov tried to optimise the multiplication algorithm we learn in elementary school. After failing to do so, he conjectured that no faster algorithms exist. This gave rise to Karatsuba's fast multiplication algorithm, an algorithm named after Anatoly Karatsuba that is faster than the elementary school algorithm. This video gives an introduction to theoretical computer science and Kolmogorov's conjecture, explains the algorithm, proves that it has a runtime faster than quadratic, and goes over the history of multiplication algorithms that came afterwards.

When soviet mathematician Kolmogorov set out to prove that there exists no faster multiplication method than the standard one we learn in elementary school, a young student by the name of Karatsuba, also trying to find a proof, managed to find a trick that beats the standard method. This video explains the high-level idea and the insight of Karatsuba's multiplication algorithm.
