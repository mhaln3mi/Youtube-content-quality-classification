Topics discussed:
A solved problem based on ER Model Concepts:
Consider the ER diagram shown in the figure for part of a BANK database. Each bank can have multiple branches, and each branch can have multiple accounts and loans. 
1. List the strong (nonweak) entity types in the ER diagram. 
2. Is there a weak entity type? If so, give its name, partial key, and identifying relationship.
3. What constraints do the partial key and the identifying relationship of the weak entity type specify in this diagram? 
4. List the names of all relationship types, and specify the (min, max) constraint on each participation of an entity type in a relationship type.
5. List concisely the user requirements that led to this ER schema design.
6. Suppose that every customer must have at least one account but is restricted to at most two loans at a time and that a bank branch cannot have more than 1,000 loans. How does this show up on the (min, max) constraints?

Topics discussed:
A solved problem and a homework problem based on Relational Model concepts:
1. Consider the following relations for a database that keeps track of student enrollment in courses and books adopted for each course:
STUDENT (SSN, Name, Major, Bdate)
COURSE (Course#, Quarter, Grade)
ENROLL (SSN, Course#, Quarter, Grade)
BOOK_ADOPTION(Course#, Quarter, Book_ISBN)
TEXT (Book_ISBN, Book_Title, Publisher, Author)
Specify the foreign keys for this schema, stating any assumptions you make.
2. Suppose that each of the following update operations is applied directly to the database state shown in the figure. Discuss all integrity constraints violated by each operation, if any, and the different ways of enforcing these constraints.
(i) Insert (‘665985475’, ‘Andrew’, 32000, 3) into EMPLOYEE. 
(ii) Insert (‘185985475’, ‘Jessica’, 40000, 7) into EMPLOYEE. 
(iii) Insert (null, ‘Computerization’, 3) into PROJECT. 
(iv) Insert (1, ‘Administration’, ‘123456879’) into DEPARTMENT. 
(v) Insert (null, ‘Finance’, ‘969598211’) into DEPARTMENT. 
(vi) Delete the EMPLOYEE tuple with SSN = ‘452635142’. 
(vii) Delete the WORKS_ON tuple with SSN = ‘452635142’ and PNo = 3. 
(viii) Delete the PROJECT tuple with PNo = 10. 
(ix) Modify the DNo of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Mgr_SSN = ‘452635142’ to 7. 
(x) Modify the Hours of the WORKS_ON tuple with SSN = ‘452635142’ and PNo = 1 to 20.

In this video, let us understand how to use ANACONDA for python. We shall see what is ANACONDA, how to use ANACONDA for python and why do we need to use ANACONDA for python. We shall also cover how to install anaconda on Mac OS. The installation would be similar for Windows and Linux systems as well.

If you are new to python, then you would probably have heard of anaconda but for a beginner it would be very confusing to know why do we need anaconda and how to use it and how is it beneficial to use anaconda over standalone python. So that is why in this video, I want to make it very clear on what is anaconda and why you should be using it.

Timestamp
00:00 Intro
00:39 What is Anaconda for python and Why do we need to use Anaconda?
03:30 How to install anaconda? Getting started with Anaconda
08:17 How to use Visual Studio code IDE with anaconda
10:05 How to create virtual environment using anaconda
12:05 How to work with different anaconda virtual environments
15:23 What are anaconda channels and how to add channels to anaconda

Anaconda is a python distribution, meaning when you install anaconda, it comes with python, a lot of python packages, tools and software which would be very essential especially if you are working in the field of data science. Anaconda also comes with conda, which is a package manager similar to pip. Conda can be used to install python packages and conda can also be used to create and manage virtual environments.
So anaconda can be treated as a bundle package which not only includes python but everything else you would need to conveniently work with python especially in the field of data science.
So we start this video by talking about what is anaconda and why we should be using it. I also mention a use case where using anaconda can be very beneficial.

Once we understand what is anaconda and why we should be using it, we then move into installing anaconda in our machine. Since I use Mac OS, the video shows how to install anaconda on Mac OS but the process would be same if you are on Windows or Linux system as well.

Once anaconda is installed, we then see how to use conda base environment. We see how to use anaconda with Visual Studio Code IDE which is also referred to as VS Code. We look at the different conda commands.
We then see how to create different virtual environments using conda command and then create specific python packages in each of our virtual environments. We then see how to work with different anaconda virtual environments in VS code.

Finally, we talk about channels in anaconda. We see what is a channel and how to add a new channel to the existing list of channels in anaconda. 

CHEAT CODE of all the ANACONDA commands used in this video:
conda (List down all conda commands)
conda list (List of all the python packages in the activated environment)
conda env list (List of all environments)
conda activate env-name (Activate environment ""env-name"")
conda deactivate (Deactivate from current conda environment)
conda create —name env-name python=3.7 (Create a virtual environment)
conda env remove —name DS-env (Remove a virtual environment)
conda install scikit-learn (Install a python package by name ""scikit-learn"")
python3 —version (Get python version in current environment)
which python3 (Get the location where python is installed)
conda config —show channels (List of all channels in anaconda)
conda config —get channels (List of all channels along with its priority)
conda config —add channels conda-forge (Add a new channel)
conda config —remove channels conda-forge (Remove a channel)

In this video, we shall understand how to connect to PostgreSQL Database from Python. We shall write a python program which will use the Psycopg2 module to connect to the PostgreSQL database and then perform some database or SQL transactions such as creating a table and then insert data to the table, updating a table data and delete records from the table using python code. We shall also see how to fetch table data from postgres database to python program.

At the end of the video, I will also cover how to use Context Manager to perform all of the above SQL operations. That is, we will use the WITH clause to connect to the database and also use the WITH clause to open the cursor. I will also mention what are the advantages of using WITH clause and why it is recommended to always use context manager or WITH clause when working with database in python.

14:30 FETCH data from PostgreSQL Table and display in Python program
17:23 UPDATE Table data in PostgreSQL database from Python program
18:50 DELETE Table record in PostgreSQL database from Python program
20:14 Using Context Manager to connect to PostgreSQL database from Python

We shall be using psycopg2 module to connect to PostgreSQL database from python, which is considered to be one of the best libraries to connect to postgres from python.

We shall start the video by covering the couple of pre-requisites which is to first install the psycopg2 module and then finding the credentials or information required to connect to the postgres database. 

After this we shall write the python program which will initially connect to the PostgreSQL database and then open a cursor which will be then used to perform the database operations like CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO Table, UPDATE Table data, DELETE table record and also how to fetch or retrieve table records or table data from the database to Python program.

Finally, we shall end the video by talking about context manager way of connecting to the database and also how to use context manager to open a cursor. Using context manager is simply using the WITH clause while connecting to the database and then also using the WITH clause while opening the cursor.
I will also mention the advantages of using a context manager over the traditional method or connecting to data and opening the cursor. And also mention why is it recommended to always use context manager when connecting to database in python.

Hopefully this video helped and gave you some useful information of using SQL within python program. If you liked it then please make sure to like the video and also subscribe to the channel.

In this video, we learn how to use logging in python. Python logging module can be used to log messages. We show why Print statement should not be used in Python for logging messages. And the advantages of using logging module over print statement in python.


This logging tutorial video also covers the different levels of logging in python. We look at DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL levels of logging in python. We explain these logging levels by writing programs and showcasing the difference in logging by setting different logging levels.


If you are new to programming, then you might consider using print statement for logging messages in Python and you may wonder why use python logging module when print can do the same things but, in this video, I give you 2 use cases of the advantages of using logging module over print in python for the purpose of logging messages.

In the beginning of this python tutorial video, we discuss how to use logging module to log messages to your console and then we also see how to log messages to a file. 
We also cover how to disable logging in python. 
We start by using the root logger which is the default logger when we use the basic configuration of logging in python. At the end of the video, we also show to create your own logger and how to create separate logger for each of your program.

We discuss why it is not recommended to use root logger and the problems of using root logger. We look at the syntax to create a unique logger for each of our program.

This video covers all the basic concepts required to get started with file handling in Python. File objects in Python can be used to read the contents of a file and also file objects can be used to write or append data into a file. 

In this video, we cover all the basic concepts required to get started with handing files in Python. We first look at how to read a file which is stored in our operating system. And then cover the concepts of how to write data into a file and also how to append data into a file. 
We check out the different between using write and append in Python.

To open the file, we use context manager as well as the traditional method to open a file. We talk about the advantages of using context manager while opening a file in python and also explain why it is recommended in python to always use context manager when dealing with files.

13:17 How to access files in different path in Python


In this video, we also talk about to how to read a file which is present in different paths or directories. By providing absolute path or relative path to the file we can tell python to look for the desired file in that specific location. However, we can also change the current working directory to point at the path where our desired file is placed.
If path is not mentioned, then Python always looks for the file in the current working directory. However, we can change the current working directory so as to point it to the location where our desired file is placed.
Alternatively, we can also provide the directory path of the file which we are trying to read. We can specify a path in two ways, one is by specifying the absolute path and second is by specifying the relative path.
In this video, we talk about relative and absolute path and also show how you can extract the current working directory and also how you can change the current working directory.

Hope you learnt something from this video. If yes, then please make sure to like and share the video with friends and colleagues who may be interested in learning about files in python.

This video is a complete tutorial on Regular Expressions in Python. This is a full course on how to use Regular Expressions in python. Regular Expression is also referred to as REGEX. Using Regular Expression, we can search for a pattern of string in the given text.

Regular Expressions are a very powerful tool used to perform complex searches on a text. By specifying a pattern for the string, we need to search for, Regular Expressions can extract a string even if it is present in different format until and unless this string follows the same pattern as mentioned in the defined Regular Expressions pattern.

In this video, we go through the different steps to be followed to use Regular Expressions in python. We also explain the different character class, special characters and also all the Regular Expressions symbols or notations which can be used to define or create a pattern in Regular Expressions in python. We also write multiple python programs to create different patterns to match an email id, phone no and date values. Finally, we also cover the sub method in Regular Expression which can replace or substitute the matched string with a replacement string.
 
There are only 4 steps to be followed in order to use Regular Expressions in python:
    1. Import re module which is the Regular Expressions module in python. All the functions and features required to perform regular expression search in python can be accessed by importing the re module.
    2. Next steps is to create the Regular Expressions Pattern. Pattern is basically the format or structure of the string that we are trying to search. In Regular Expressions, we have several different character classes, symbols and special characters which will help us to identify every kind of characters or symbols hence making it possible to define a pattern to search of any type of string.
    3. Once the pattern is defined, next step is to search for this pattern in the given text or data.
    4. Finally, we extract all the matched string.

This video is aimed at absolute beginners. We cover how to create dictionaries in python and how to access values from a python dictionary. We cover how to update a dictionary in python and also how to delete an item in python dictionary. 

We go through several important python dictionary methods so as to access the python dictionary keys, values and items. We see how to use them in for loop. 
We also go through methods like get() and setdefault() so as to get an idea of the different possibilities available in python to manage data present in dictionaries. 

Finally, we also look at a way to display the dictionary values more beautifully by using the pprint module.


In the near future, all the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/

Lists is a data type in Python. But unlike other data types such as string, integer, float etc. Lists can hold multiple values. The specialty of Lists in Python is that it can hold values of any data type. List can also contain multiple lists within it. In python we can identify a value as list of it is enclosed within the square bracket. 

To define a variable as a list, enter the values within a square bracket. Each value within the list must be separated by a comma. Lists are mutable in nature meaning that values in list can be modified. Individual values within a list can be accessed by using the index. 

Index is the position of each value within the list. In Python Index always starts with zero. Multiple values within the list can be accessed using slices. Slices is nothing but passing two index values separated by a colon.

There are several methods inbuilt to a list in python. Append is a method used to add a value to the end of the list. Whereas remove is the method used to remove a value or item from the list. Similarly, there are several other methods that can be used with a list to perform specific task. This is explained in detail in this video.

The video also explains about how to use lists in for loop and how to use the enumerate function within for loop. We also cover list concatenation and list replication in this video. 

Sorting of lists and finding the length of a list are other topics covered in this video.
This video is aimed at complete beginners so anyone getting started with python should find the video useful. This video is part of the Python Tutorial series for complete beginners. This is the 9th video in this series.

Handling exceptions is one of the most important aspects of a good python program hence in python we can handle exceptions by placing the block of code which we assume to be causing error inside a try and except block. 
Any error caused by the block of code within the try except clause won’t be returned to the user but will be handled by the except block. 

In Python, we can also raise user defined exceptions using the raise Exception clause. Raise exception can be used anywhere in the code to cause an error based on certain conditions. 
We can raise and exception within the try except block so the user defined error can be caught by the try except block. 

Within try except exception handling in python, we can also use ELSE and FINALLY clause. Block of code within else will be executed when the code within try does not throw an error. If the block of code within try causes an exception, then the except block will be called and the block of code within except will be executed. 
Block of code within finally, will be executed every time. Meaning whether there is an exception or not, if you have mentioned finally in your try exception block then the block of code within finally will always be executed.

This video is aimed at complete beginners who are just getting started with programming or with python programming. The concepts are explaining in the most basic manner so anyone can understand it. 

The purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners.

We also check out the five things you need to remember when working with local and global variables in python.

This is the seventh video in the series of python tutorial for beginners. This video is focused on understanding the different scope in a python program. We see how to identify a local scope and a global scope and then see how to create a local and global variable in python.

Python supports both local and global variables but there are certain rules to follow when working with local and global variables. Important things to note are:
1. Local variables cannot be accessed in global scope.
2. Local variables cannot be accessed from other local scope.
3. Global variables can be accessed by any local scope.
4. Local and Global variables can share the same name.
5. Global variables can be modified inside a local scope using the “global” keyword.

I explain what is a FUNCTION in Python, how to create a function and how to call a function in a python program. This is the sixth video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners. How to write a function in python program and different functionalities associated with python functions are covered in this video.

We start by explaining the definition of function and show a sample python code to create a function. How to create a function with a parameter and without a parameter is shown with sample python program. We look at what a parameter is and how to pass an argument during function call. We discuss the difference between an argument and a parameter in python functions.

We also cover return statements in python function. We see what happens when we write a function without a return statement. We also cover how to pass a return value in function. 

Finally, we go through each of these concepts in python functions by writing a sample python program to count the number of vowel characters in a given name. In this sample program we create a function named count vowels using the DEF keyword and then pass a parameter to it. From the python program we call this count vowels function and pass an argument which will be used by our function to find the number of vowel characters in it.

This video is aimed at beginners who would like to understand what a function is in python and how to create a function in python and how to use a parameter and use a return statement in python functions.

We also discuss how to import modules from different directory. 
We see how to write import statement in python using the inbuilt modules in python and then see how to write our own modules and then import this module in our python program. This video also tells you how you can import modules which are present in different directory which is other than the directory of your python program.

This video will give you complete details of IMPORT statement in python and the advantages of using them in our python program. The concepts are explained in detail for complete beginners. This is the fifth video in the series of Python Tutorial for beginners. 

I explain the concepts by writing python program to import different types of modules in python. We see some example of how to import and use some of the in-built modules in python. Later I also write my own python modules and then import it in my python program. Finally, I place my own module in a new directory and then show you steps in detail how you can add this new directory permanently into sys.path variable so python can import modules from this directory.

IF ELSE Statement in Python are part of the Flow Control Statements. This is the third video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners. But before writing IF statement, we learn what is a Boolean data type, what are comparison operators and what are boolean operators or Logical operators. These concepts are required to be understood before starting with IF ELSE statement.


IF statement is part of the Flow Control statements in python which also includes loop statements such as while loop and for loop. 
Flow control statement or control flow statement in python decides which instruction to execute based on which condition hence it’s a very essential part of python programming.

The condition in IF statement either needs to have an expression which always evaluate to a boolean value or the condition in IF statement needs to have a boolean value. 
Understanding of Python Boolean is essential to understand IF statement. We also cover boolean operator which is also referred to as logical operator. Finally we also look into comparison operator which is required to form an expression which can be used in IF statement.

IF statement in python also includes ELIF (which stands for ELSE IF) and ELSE section which is explained in the video by writing sample program which uses these IF, ELSE and ELIF statements to perform certain actions.

All these concepts are not just explained theoretically but also by working out some examples using the IDLE IDE which comes along with your Python installation and also using Visual Studio code IDE to write and execute python program.

In this video, we cover python variables, how to create a variable and how to create variable of different data type. We also learn how to use a variable in python program and what is the purpose of having a variable in python.

Python Variables are the most basic python programming concept and having a clear understanding of how and when to create a variable is very important.

Python variables are not declared and same python variable can hold values of any data type. These concepts will be covered in the video.
We will also write sample python program which uses a variable to perform certain actions.

This video also covers the rules for creating variables in python and how python variable is different from other programming languages. We also look at few samples for valid and invalid variable names in python.
 
All these concepts are not just explained theoretically but also by working out some examples using the IDLE IDE which comes along with your Python installation and also using Visual Studio code IDE to write and execute python program.

The purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners.

All the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/ 
So please make sure to check that out as well.

This is the first video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners.
This video covers most basic python programming concepts. We look at Arithmetic Operators and Expression in Python. We then look at the most commonly used Data Types in Python which are Strings, Integer and Float.
 
This video also covers how certain arithmetic operators such as + and * can be used to perform string concatenation and string replication respectively.

All these concepts are not just explained theoretically but also by working out some examples using the IDLE IDE which comes along with your Python installation.

In this video we only look at arithmetic operators but Python has many other types of operators such as Boolean Operators, Comparison operators etc which will be covered in the future video’s. 
Also, only the most commonly used data type is covered in this video which are string, integer and float. However, Python also has few other data types such as Boolean, List etc which will be covered in future video’s.

We start by installing Python 3 and then go through 3 ways to write and execute Python program on Mac.
3 ways to write and execute Python program covered in this video are:
    1. Using IDLE, which is an IDE that comes along with Python installation.
    2. Using any text editor (in my case I use Atom) to write python program and then execute the program using Terminal window.
    3. By using Visual Studio Code (or simple VS Code), which is considered as one of the best IDE for Python.

Installing Python 3 on Mac can be confusing due to the existence of Python 2 which is preinstalled on all Mac OS. However, Python 2 and Python 3 can co-exist on the same machine hence we do not need to uninstall Python 2 before installing Python 3.

To Install Python 3, there are no prerequisites, and the installation is pretty straight forward.
To run your Python code may be confusing for beginners hence in this video we cover 3 different ways or 3 different editors which can be used to get started with writing and running python code.

When executing python code through IDLE, it’s essential to execute the RUN command from the text editor and then view the output in IDLE interpreter.
Whereas text editor does not have the functionality to run program by itself hence we use Terminal window to run the program.
Visual Studio Code (or simple VS Code) along with PyCharm, Jupiter Notebook and few others are considered as one of the best IDE for Python hence in this video we show how VS Code can be used to write and Run Python program.

The video is aimed at helping beginners to get started with installation of Python programming language on Mac and by showing multiple ways to start writing and executing Python code.

Now why exactly do we need to put them in containers? Because we have already extracted the data. Can;t we just put them in some kind of database? The answer is yes. You can. But there might be a few problems when you are storing the data directly in the database when you are working on big/multiple projects.

Scrapy spiders can return the extracted data as Python dictionaries which we have already been doing right with our quotes project. But the problem with Python dictionaries is that it lacks structure. It is easy to make a typo in a field name or return inconsistent data, especially in a larger project with many spiders.

So it's always a good idea to move the scraped data to temporary location called containers and then store them inside the database. So these temporary containers are called as items.

So if we discuss the flow of our scraped data it somewhat looks like this. It first gets scraped by our spider then it is stored inside the temporary containers called items and then you can store them inside a JSON file. But if we want send this data to a database we have to add one more step to this flow. After storing them inside item containers we are going to send them to this pipeline where this process_item method is automatically called and the item variable will contain are scraped data.

Now before watching this video make sure that you have watched previous two videos in which we cover how to store data inside an sqlite database because a lot of the concepts that I teach in those videos are going to be used in this video. And I don't want to go over them again.

Now the first thing we need to do is install MySQL on our computer. You can go to this link if you are on windows to install MySQL. But if you are using Linux you can check this link out to install and use MySQL. I am going to covering only the windows part of installation because the Linux installation is pretty easy.

Now just click on this link to start the installation. I am going through this installation pretty quickly because it's simple. While installing make sure that you choose the developer's default option because we want everything installed on our computer including Connectors, routers, servers and MySQL Work Bench which is a GUI software to connect and handle various connections.

Also when you are asked to choose the root password. You can choose whatever you want but make sure that you remember the root password because we are going to be using the same password everywhere. If you forget this password it's going to be difficult to reset it.

Steps -

1) Install MySQL https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
Linux - https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/installing-mysql-server-on-ubuntu/

- Make sure you go with default options.
- Remember the root password

2) Install MySQL-connector-python
2) Create a new connection using Mysql workbench
3) Create a new database myquotes using SQL workbench
4) Write the code in Pipelines
5) Scrape the data
6) Show the data in SQL Workbench

Now why are we exactly learning to login? A lot of websites will restrict the content that you might want to scrape behind a login page. So to scrape that restricted data. It's always a good idea to learn how to login into websites using scrapy.

Now just to internalize the concepts we have learned, we will be a working on a complete really life project of scraping amazon.com

We will be scraping the books department of amazon. More specifically the collection of books that were released in the last 30 days. Now if you are following along, you don't have to choose books. You can choose any department on amazon.

I already created the project 'AmazonTutorial' on pycharm and have installed scrapy. If you don't remember how to install scrapy you can always go back to my installing scrapy video.

Now before we run our spider, I just want you want to tell you that are program might not work. If you have scraped amazon before then it's not going to work but if this you first time then the above code will work. The reason for it not working is that amazon puts on restrictions when you are trying to scrape a lot of its data. So we are going to bypass those restriction by using something known as user agents. But before we get into that lets actually run our program

So what exactly is this user agent and how is it able to bypass the restrictions placed by amazon?

Whenever a browser like chrome or Mozilla visits a website, that website asks for the identity of your browser. That identity of you browser is known as a user-agent. And if we give the same identity to a website like amazon. It places restrictions and sometimes bans the computer from visiting amazon.

So there are two ways to trick amazon. First is to use user-agents that are allowed by amazon. For example, amazon has to allow Google to crawl it's website if it wants it's products to be shown on Google Search. So we can basically replace our user-agent with Google's user-agent which is known as Google bot and trick amazon into thinking that actually Google is crawling the website and not us. And this exactly what we did in the last video. We found out the Google's user-agent name by typing it in Google Search. And then we replaced our user agent with Google.

The other way is to keep rotating our user-agents. If amazon identifies our computer using our user-agent then we can probably use fake user-agents in rotation and trick amazon into thinking that a lot of browsers are visiting the website instead of just one and this is what we will be learning in this video.

Before we go into proxies, you need to understand what is an IP address. An IP address is basically an address of your computer. You can find your own IP address by going to google and typing in 'What is my IP'.

Whenever you connect to a website you are automatically telling them your IP address. A website like amazon can recognize your IP address and ban you if you try to scrape a lot of it's data. But what if used a another IP address instead of our own. And even better we can use a lot of IP addresses that our not our own, and put them in rotation. So we every-time we send a request to amazon. It's going to be with a different IP address. 

When you use an IP address that is not your own. Then that other IP address is known as a proxy. If we look up the definition of proxy on google it says 'the authority to represent someone else'. So basically we are hiding our address and using someone elses.

We'll then progress onto more advanced and sophisticated topics that integrate artificial neural networks and deep learning into reinforcement learning. We'll also be getting our hands dirty by implementing some super cool reinforcement learning projects in code! Without further ado, let's get to it!

In this video, we'll discuss Markov decision processes, or MDPs. Markov decision processes give us a way to formalize sequential decision making. This formalization is the basis for structuring problems that are solved with reinforcement learning. 

We will detail the components that make up an MDP, including: the environment, the agent, the states of the environment, the actions the agent can take in the environment, and the rewards that may be given to the agent for its actions.

We'll see that the return is exactly what's driving the agent to make the decisions it makes. We'll also introduce the idea of episodes and talk about episodic tasks vs. continuing tasks.

In this video, we'll be introducing the idea of Q-learning with value iteration, which is a reinforcement learning technique used for learning the optimal policy in a Markov Decision Process. 

We'll illustrate how this technique works by introducing a game where a reinforcement learning agent tries to maximize points, and through this, we'll also learn about Q-tables and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

Last time, we left our discussion of Q-learning with the question of how an agent chooses to either explore the environment or to exploit it in order to select its actions. In this video, we'll answer this question by introducing a type of strategy called an epsilon greedy strategy.

We'll also explore how, using this strategy, the agent makes decisions about the actions it takes. We'll also see how exactly Q-value is calculated and updated in the Q-table mathematically using an example from the lizard game we introduced last time.

Machine learning : 
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

What is machine learning used for?

Machine learning is used in internet search engines, email filters to sort out spam, websites to make personalized recommendations, banking software to detect unusual transactions, and lots of apps on our phones such as voice recognition.

What are the four types of machine learning?
There are four types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement.

What is meant by logistic regression?
Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.

What is the main purpose of logistic regression?
Logistic regression is used to obtain odds ratio in the presence of more than one explanatory variable. The procedure is quite similar to multiple linear regression, with the exception that the response variable is binomial. The result is the impact of each variable on the odds ratio of the observed event of interest.

Why logistic regression is the best?
Logistic regression is a simple and more efficient method for binary and linear classification problems. It is a classification model, which is very easy to realize and achieves very good performance with linearly separable classes. It is an extensively employed algorithm for classification in industry.

SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm and mostly used for classification problems but we can use it for regression problems also.

The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane (Line)which is separating the classes of your dataset in a good way . For that we calculate a Margin. A margin is a gap between the line with the closest class points of the dataset. I have explained the whole concept in a video. Please go through it.

The common data format in Machine Learning is a CSV file (comma separated values). In this Tutorial I show 4 different ways how you can load the data from such files and then prepare the data. I also show you some best practices on how to deal with the correct data type, missing values, and an optional header. The 4 approaches are:

- with the csv module
- with numpy: np.loadtxt() and numpy.genfromtxt()
- with pandas: pd.read_csv()
